Hi! 

Welcome to see my thesis project. The programming is done with RStudio and branches named with "demo". As you can see I am still a beginner so pull requests directly may not be implemented perfectly. 

The topic is around themes like how can I combine machine learning methods in GWAS. The idea is that ML methods could boost GWAS study design, since some of it have not developed so quickly.
It could take like a decade or few years since last research paper have been published, so the field is growing, but have not succeeded as possibly hoped for.
